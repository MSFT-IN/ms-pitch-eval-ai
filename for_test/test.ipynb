       "TranscriptionVerbose(duration=326.30999755859375, language='english', text=\"Hello, I am Sang-Jun Park, who is in charge of strategic implementation and business operations in security at Microsoft Korea. Today, I would like to explain how to support multi-cloud DevOps through Microsoft Copilot for Security in various security sessions of Build. Before we start the session, I need to explain about Copilot for Security. For those of you who don't know about Copilot for Security, let me briefly explain. It is the world's first and only AI-based security solution based on GPT-4. We released a preview about a year ago, and it was officially introduced in April this year. It is a solution that can innovatively raise the level of customer cyber security through AI. It is based on enormous data. Copilot for Security was learned through about 65 security signals. We support you with machine speed and scale through this. What this means is that we help customers through very fast speed and scale. It is like putting a super-high-end or medium-end security engine next to us, learning simple things from them, and helping us with our work. Unlike conventional AI, this is provided exclusively for companies. Also, customer data is not used for AI learning. So, you can use AI without worrying about customer data leakage. Of course, in this build, the product linked to Copilot for Security has been expanded. We call it MDC. It has been expanded to Defender for Cloud. This time, it is still a public preview. I will give you a detailed explanation of this. First, let me tell you about the operation method. As you can see from the title, it is machine speed and scale. As I said, it has very fast speed and scalability. In general, security workers can complete their work in a few minutes in a few hours or a few days. This means that we have expanded these capabilities to MDC. If you look at the left, there are three benefits. First, you can simplify complicated things. In fact, there are a lot of security signals, but you can easily classify and respond by reducing these noises and using self-data. The second feature is to detect without missing. If you use Copilot and MDC together, security managers can capture everything without missing by filtering the noise and modify it quickly to simplify the complexity. Finally, it is to respond quickly. In order to solve problems on the source code, AI provides a solution action. Through this, you can quickly solve the problem. I'll give you a detailed explanation of this next time. First, the first feature is to find out the risk. It can quickly tell you what is important and dangerous in the customer cloud environment. First, if you look at the right screen, the left is the MDC screen and the right is the Copilot screen embedded. And if you look at the top, there are various sources such as Azure, GCP, AWS. So, if the MDC on the left captures information about security risks, the Copilot on the right can ask more detailed questions, analyze, and respond. And as an example, I told you to summarize the contents on the left, and the right tells you those contents and provides insights. The second feature is Risk Remediation. It helps you respond to risks. So, using the AI-integrated remediation function, you can receive a warning, read it, understand the content, and take the necessary action. If you look at the right screen for a moment, you can see a summary and insight on the current situation on the previous screen. This time, I told the Copilot to ask where the resources related to vulnerability are, and I asked him to focus on that a little more. You can see that the Copilot is telling you about this. Lastly, there is the automated threat remediation function. It uses the full request function created by the AI to correct code miscomplications on DevOps. If you look at the right on the left, it asks if you will submit a full request to solve the problem on Azure DevOps. So, if you submit this, the contents will be updated to Azure DevOps and you can correct the wrong explanation. To sum up, you can quickly understand the current situation through MDC and Copilot, and you can get a guide and automated solution to solve the problem. Through this, you can operate security more smartly than before. This is the effect you can get by linking Copilot for Security, an AI solution, and Microsoft Vendor for Cloud for cloud security. That's it for today's explanation. Please continue to pay attention to Microsoft security.

      "안녕하세요. 저는 한국 마이크로소프트에서 보안 부분에 대한 전략 수립과 그다음에 사업 운영을 담당하고 있는 박상준이라고 합니다. 오늘 저는 빌드 여러 보안 세션 중에서 마이크로소프트 코파일럿 포스케이트를 통한 멀티 클라우드 데브옵스를 지원하는 방법이 어떤 것이 있는지 설명을 드리고자 합니다.\n",
      "먼저 세션 시작하기 전에 인제 코파일럿 퍼시기 때문에 설명을 좀 먼저 드릴 필요가 있는데요. 코파일럿 시큐리티에 대해서 모르시는 분이 있을 수 있어서 먼저 설명을 간단하게 드리면 전 세계 최초 그리고 유일한 GPT 기반의 생성형 AI 기반 보안 솔루션입니다. 저희가 1년 전쯤에 프리뷰를 발표하였고요. 올해 사월에 정식 출시가 되었습니다. 그 AI를 통해서 고객의 사이버 보안 수준을 혁신적으로 올릴 수 있는 솔루션이 되겠습니다.\n",
      "이 기반에는 어마어마한 데이터를 기반으로 학습되어 있는데요. 약 65조 개 보안 시그널을 통해서 코파일럿 퍼시트를 학습시켰고요. 이를 통해서 머신 스피드하고 스케일로 저희가 지원해 드리는데 이 말은 무슨 말이냐면 굉장히 빠른 속도와 스케일을 통해서 고객을 도와드린다는 얘기고요. 어 이는 마치 우리 옆에 음 초급이나 중급 보안 엔진을 두고 이분들한테 간단한 내용들을 학습시키고 저희 업무를 도움을 주게 하는 형태와 같습니다.\n",
      "어 일반적인 AI와 달리 이거는 이제 기업 전용으로 제공이 되고요. 또 고객의 데이터를 AI 학습용으로 활용하지 않습니다. 그래서 고객의 데이터에 대한 유출 걱정 없이 어 AI를 활용할 수 있습니다. 아울러 이번 빌드에서는 코파일럿 시큐리티에 연동되는 제품이 더 확대되어서 저희가 이제 MDC라고 부르는데요. 어 디펜더 포 클라우드까지 확대가 되었습니다. 요번에는 아직 퍼블릭 미리보기 상태인데요. 이에 대한 자세한 설명을 드리도록 하겠습니다.\n",
      "먼저 동작 방식에 대한 부분을 말씀드리도록 하겠습니다. 어 제목에서 보시면 머신 스피드하고 스케일인데요. 말씀드렸다시피 매우 빠른 속도와 확장성을 갖고 있고요. 어 일반적으로 보안 업무자가 몇 시간 또는 며칠 걸리던 작업들을 어 몇 분 이내 어 완료할 수 있는 것이 되겠고요. 이러한 역량들을 MLOps까지 어 확대했다는 얘기가 되겠습니다. 왼쪽을 보시면 세 가지 베리핏이 있는데요. 먼저 첫 번째는.\n",
      "복잡한 것을 단순화 시킬 수 있습니다. 실제로는 보안 시그널들이 엄청나게 많은데 이런 노이즈를 줄이고 자연어를 이용해서 쉽게 분류하고 대응할 수 있습니다. 어 2번째 특징은 어 놓치는 거 없이 탐지하는 것입니다. 코파일럿과 MDC를 같이 사용하면 보안 관리자들은 노이즈를 필터링함으로써 놓치는 것이 없이 모든 것을 잘 포착하고 빠르게 수정해서 복잡성을 간소화시킬 수 있습니다. 마지막.\n",
      "으로는 빠르게 대응하는 것인데요. 소스 코드 상에서 문제가 있거나 그런 거를 해결하기 위해서 AI가 해결한 액션을 제공해 드리고 있습니다. 이런 것들을 통해서 문제를 빠르게 해결할 수 있습니다. 이에 대한 각각 대한 설명을 다음번에 드리도록 하겠습니다. 먼저 1번째 기능인데요, 위험 사항을 알아보는 것입니다. 고객사 클라우드 환경에서 어떤 부분이 중요하고 위험한지를 빠르게 알려줄 수 있는 건데요. 먼저 오른쪽 화면을 보시면 왼쪽이 이제 MDC 화면이고 오른쪽이 임베디드에 있는 코.\n",
      "화면입니다. 그리고 상단에 보시면 애저 주시 PAWS 뭐 이런 여러 가지 솔루션들이 있습니다. 그래서 왼쪽에서 MDC가 보안 위험 상황에 대해서 정보를 캡처하면 오른쪽에 코파일럿을 갖고 좀 더 세부적인 내용을 물어본다던가 분석한다든가 대응할 수 있게 되겠습니다. 그리고 현재 예시로는 왼쪽에 있는 내용들을 좀 써머리 해라고 했더니 오른쪽에서 예, 그런 내용들을 알려주고 이에 대한 인사이트를 제공해 주고 있습니다.\n",
      "2번째 기능은 리스크 레미데이션인데요. 위험에 대해서 대응해 주는 것을 도와주는 겁니다. 그래서 AI 통합돼 있는 그 레미데이션 기능을 활용해서 권고 사항을 받을 수 있고 이걸 읽어보시고 내용을 이해해서 어 필요한 액션을 취할 수 있습니다. 오른쪽 화면을 잠깐 보시면 어? 이 점 화면에서는 현재 상황에 대한 써머리하고 인사이트 볼 수 있었는데요. 이번에는 코파일럿한테 어떠한 위험성이 있는 벌너빌리티에 관련된 리소스가 어디에 있는지를 물어보라고 했는데.\n",
      "그거에 대해서 조금 더 포커스해서 알려달라라고 명령을 하였구요. 어? 이에 대해서 코파일럿이 알려주고 있음을 확인할 수 있습니다. 마지막으로는 자동화되어 있는 그 위협 레미디에이션 기능인데요. 어 AI 생성된 풀 리퀘스트 기능을 이용하여 그 대규모 시스템에서 코드 위드 컴플라이언스 같은 것들을 수정하게 하는 것입니다. 그 왼쪽에 오른쪽을 보시면 애저 대시보드 상에 문제가 있는 부분을 해결하기 위해서 풀 리퀘스트를 서밋 하겠냐고 물어보게 됩니다. 그래서 이걸 서밋하면 해당 내용들이 어 예전.\n",
      "업데이트가 되고 잘못된 설명을 수정할 수 있습니다.\n",
      "그 정리해 보면 MDC 하고 코파일럿을 통해서 현재의 상태를 확실하게 알 수 있고 어 문제 해결을 위하여 가이드와 자동화된 해결책을 얻을 수 있고요. 어 이를 통해서 이전에 비해서 좀 더 스마트하게 보안 운영을 하실 수 있습니다. 이것이 AI 솔루션인 코파일럿 포 시큐리티하고 클라우드 보안을 위한 마이크로소프트 벤더 포 클라우드의 연동을 통해서 얻을 수 있는 효과입니다.\n",
